# Hyperparameter Tuning

This repository illustrates how different hyperparameter tuning methods can be used to tune neural network models built with Keras.

The project follows a tutorial-like approach, where the implementation details are thoroughly discussed alongside with the code. Three different methods were implemented:

* **Grid Search** with scikit-learn's GridSearchCV
* **Random Search** with scikit-learn's RandomizedSearchCV
* **Bayesian Optimization** with Hyperopt
